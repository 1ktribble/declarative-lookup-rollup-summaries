Usage Information and Known Issues
----------------------------------

- This tool uses [SOQL Aggregate](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/langCon_apex_SOQL_agg_fns.htm) queries and is subject to [platform limitations](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_gov_limits.htm). This basically means...
- For each rollup, there is a maximum of 50,000 child relation records that can be summarised each time child record/s insert/update/delete operations are made (which may process several configured rollups). The rollup processes children to rollup by their parent record relationship and an optional further filter if provided. Meaning so long as this relationship does not result in more than 50,000 child records per parent parent record it will be successful. Take a look at the second blog post above which describes some new configuration settings to help calibrate the tool when running the Scheduled or Calculate jobs to help work within the 50,000 row limit.
- For performance reasons ensure the fields used are indexed (lookups are by default) and also any fields used in the filter criteria. This can be very important as without this, a full table scan will occur when the platform executes the SOQL and cause performance issues. For more information from Salesforce please see [here](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Best_Practices_for_Deployments_with_Large_Data_Volumes) and [here](http://blogs.developerforce.com/engineering/2013/02/force-com-soql-best-practices-nulls-and-formula-fields.html).
- When using the Realtime mode, Formula fields as fields to aggregate are not supported (validation will be added in a future release to block this). To work around this, either switch to Scheduled mode or in Relatime mode use a Workflow Field Update to copy the formula field value to a physical field and reference that.
- While the tool can be installed and enabled directly in production, sandbox testing is still strongly recommended.

Installing the Source Code (Developers)
=======================================

If you are a developer obtain the source code from this repository if you wish to develop it further and/or contribute to it. Click [Deploy to Salesforce](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com/app/githubdeploy/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries) to deploy the source code to your developer org.

**KNOWN INSTALL ISSUE** Sometimes the Permission Set files will not deploy, based on org differences, such as features enabled. If you encounter this problem, Clone the repo manually and use your IDE or Ant script to deploy without the Permission Sets. I will be looking into fixing this [issue](https://github.com/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries/issues/58) in the future.
